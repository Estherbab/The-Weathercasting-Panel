# The-Weathercasting-Panel

## Description
In this challenge I will be creating a weather dashboard that will feature and retrieve weather data for different cities. 
I will be using the OpenWeatherMAP API to retrieve geographical coordinates for each city, this will help me to retrieve weather data for each of the cities, displaying the name, date, weather icon, temperature, wind-speed, and humidity, for the current day as well as the forecast for the next 5 days for that particular city.
